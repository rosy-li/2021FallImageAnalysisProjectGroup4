This is the repository of the image analysis project from group 4.
In this file, there are 3 scripts doing image analysis for our final project "Image analysis of breast tumor X-ray projections and CT scans". 
Please refer to the poster and paper submission to run the 3 demos for 3 parts of analysis: Image feature extraction, Lasso regression and 3D analysis. 

Due to the file upload limit of Github, we were unable to upload all original data to this Repo. Please refer to the https://zenodo.org/record/5084116#.YbKhH_HMK3I 2D dataset and https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vj83jj6fvt/2 3D dataset for raw data download.
